In this video, we'll delve into the fundamental concepts of IP addressing and subnetting, crucial for setting up efficient communication across various environments including AWS, Azure, and on-premises setups.

Understanding IP addressing is akin to assigning phone numbers to devices in a network. IPv4, the traditional protocol, and IPv6, its successor, are the two types of IP addresses we'll explore. While IPv4 uses a range of numbers from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, IPv6 employs longer addresses for increased capacity.

The IPv4 address space is divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E, each serving different purposes. Classes A, B, and C were commonly used based on network size and requirements, while Classes D and E were reserved for multicast addressing and experimental purposes, respectively.

You might wonder why Class A ranges from 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255, excluding 127.0.0.0. The 127.0.0.0 range is reserved for loopback addresses, allowing a device to ping itself, as demonstrated by using commands like "ping localhost" and "ping 127.0.0.1".

The concept of public and private IP addresses arises from the limited IPv4 address space. Private IP addresses, specified by RFC1918, are reserved for internal use within closed infrastructures or office environments.

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)
We'll demonstrate the distinction between private and public IP addresses using command prompts, showcasing internal IP configurations versus public IP addresses retrieved from external networks.
